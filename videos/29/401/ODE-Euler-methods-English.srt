Dear Friends,  Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on <b>Solving ODEs using Euler Methods</b>.

2
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
At the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:17
Solve <b>ODEs</b> using <b>Euler</b> and <b>Modified Euler methods</b> in <b>Scilab</b>

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
Develop <b>Scilab</b> code to solve <b>ODEs</b>.

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
To record this tutorial, I am using

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
<b>Ubuntu 12.04</b> as the operating system

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
and <b>Scilab 5.3.3</b> version.

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
To practice this tutorial, a learner

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
should have basic knowledge of <b>Scilab</b>

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
and should know how to solve <b>ODEs.</b>

11
00:00:40 --> 00:00:47
To learn <b>Scilab,</b> please refer to the relevant tutorials available on the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> website.

12
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
In <b>Euler method,</b> we get an accurately approximate solution of the <b>ODE.</b>

13
00:00:55 --> 00:01:02
It is used to solve initial value problems where initial values of the <b>differential equation</b> are given.

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
It can be used to solve <b>continuous functions.</b>

15
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
Let us solve an example using <b>Euler method.</b>

16
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
We are given an initial value problem -

17
00:01:15 --> 00:01:19
<b>y dash is equal to minus two t minus y.</b>

18
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
The initial value of y is given as <b>minus one</b>(-1)

19
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
and the <b>step length</b> is given as <b>zero point one</b>(0.1).

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
We have to find the value of <b>y</b> at time <b>t equal to zero point five.</b>

21
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
Let us look at the code for <b>Euler method.</b>

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:46
Open <b>Euler underscore o d e dot sci</b> on <b>Scilab editor.</b>

23
00:01:47 --> 00:01:57
We define the function <b>Euler underscore o d e</b> with arguments <b>f, t init, y init, h</b> and <b>N</b>

24
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
'where: <b>f</b> denotes the function to be solved,

25
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
<b>t init</b> is the initial value of time <b>t</b>,

26
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
<b>y init</b>  is the initial value of <b>y</b>,

27
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
<b>h</b> is the <b>step length</b> and <b>n</b> is the number of <b>iterations.</b>

28
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
Then we initialize the values of <b>t</b> and <b>y</b> to vectors of <b>zeros.</b>

29
00:02:21 --> 00:02:28
We place the initial values of <b>t</b> and <b>y</b> in <b>t of one</b> and <b>y of one</b> respectively.

30
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Then we <b>iterate</b> from <b>one to N</b> to find the value of <b>y</b>.

31
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
Here we apply <b>Euler method</b> to find the value of <b>y. </b>

32
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Finally we <b>end</b> the <b>function.</b>

33
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
<b>Save and execute</b> the file <b>Euler underscore o d e dot sci</b>.

34
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
Switch to <b>Scilab console</b> to solve the example problem.

35
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
We define the <b> function </b> by typing

36
00:02:56 --> 00:03:25
<b>d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y dot close square bracket equal to f of t comma y close single quote comma open single quote y dot equal to open parenthesis minus two asterisk t close parenthesis minus y close single quote close parenthesis </b>

37
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Press <b>Enter. </b>

38
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
Then type: <b>t init is equal to zero. </b>

39
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Press <b>Enter.</b>

40
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
Type: <b>y init is equal to minus one.</b>

41
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
Press <b>Enter </b>.

42
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
Type: <b>step length h is equal to zero point one.</b>

43
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
Press <b>Enter</b>.

44
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
The <b>step length</b> is zero point one and we have to find the value of <b>y</b> at <b>zero point five.</b>

45
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
So, the number of <b>iterations</b> should be <b>five.</b>

46
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
At each <b>iteration,</b>  the value of <b>t</b> will be increased by <b>zero point one.</b>

47
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
So type capital <b>N is equal to five</b> (N=5)

48
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
and press <b>Enter.</b>

49
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
To <b>call</b> the <b>function,</b> type:

50
00:04:14 --> 00:04:32
<b>open square bracket t comma y close square bracket equal to Euler underscore o d e open parenthesis f comma t init comma y init comma h comma capital N close parenthesis </b>

51
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
Press <b>Enter.</b>

52
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
The value of <b>y at t equal to zero point five</b> is shown.

53
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Now let us look at <b>Modified Euler method. </b>

54
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
It is a <b>second order method</b> and is a <b>stable two step method. </b>

55
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
We find the <b>average</b> of the <b>function</b> at the beginning and end of <b>time step.</b>

56
00:04:56 --> 00:05:01
Let us solve this example using <b>Modified Euler method.</b>

57
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
We are given a <b>function y dash is equal to t plus y plus t y. </b>

58
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
The initial value of <b>y</b> is <b>one</b>

59
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
and the <b>step length</b> is <b>zero point zero one.</b>

60
00:05:16 --> 00:05:24
We have to find the value of <b>y</b>  at <b>time t equal to zero point one </b> using <b>Modified Euler's method.</b>

61
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
Let us look at the code for <b>Modified Euler method</b> on <b>Scilab Editor</b>.

62
00:05:31 --> 00:05:38
We define the <b>function</b> with <b>arguments f, t init, y init, h</b> and <b>n</b>

63
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
where: <b>f</b> is the <b>function</b> to be solved,

64
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
<b>t init</b> is the intial <b>time</b> value,

65
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
<b>y init</b> is the inital value of  <b>y</b>,

66
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
<b>h</b> is the <b>step length</b> and

67
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
<b>N</b> is the number of <b>iterations.</b>

68
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
Then we initialize the <b>arrays</b> for <b>y</b> and <b>t.</b>

69
00:05:58 --> 00:06:06
We place the initial values of <b>t</b> and <b>y</b> in <b>t of one</b> and <b>y of one</b> respectively.

70
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
We implement <b>Modified Euler Method</b> here.

71
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
Here we find the average value of <b>y</b> at the beginning and end of <b>time step.</b>

72
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
<b>Save and execute</b> the file <b>Modi Euler underscore o d e dot sci.</b>

73
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Switch to <b>Scilab console.</b>

74
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
Clear the screen by typing <b>c l c.</b>

75
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
Press <b>Enter.</b>

76
00:06:32 --> 00:07:00
Define the <b>function</b> by typing <b>d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y dot close square bracket equal to f of t comma y close single quote comma open single quote y dot equal to t plus y plus t asterisk y close single quote close parenthesis</b>

77
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Press <b>Enter.</b>

78
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
Then type: <b>t init equal to zero</b>,  press Enter.

79
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Type: <b>y init equal to one</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

80
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
Then type: <b>h equal to zero point zero one</b> press <b>Enter.</b>

81
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
Type: capital <b>N equal to ten</b>

82
00:07:22 --> 00:07:33
since the number of <b>iterations</b> should be <b>ten</b> to <b>time t equal to zero point one</b> with <b>step length</b> of <b>zero point zero one.</b>

83
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
Press <b>Enter.</b>

84
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
Then call the <b>function Modi Euler underscore o d e</b> by typing:

85
00:07:41 --> 00:08:02
<b>open square bracket t comma y close square bracket equal to Modi Euler underscore o d e open parenthesis f comma t init comma y init comma h comma capital N close parenthesis</b>

86
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
Press <b>Enter. </b>

87
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
The value of <b>y at t equal to zero point one</b> is shown.

88
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
