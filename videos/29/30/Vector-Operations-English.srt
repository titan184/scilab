00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Vector Operations</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
At the end of this spoken tutorial you will be able to:

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
* Define a vector.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
* Calculate length of a vector.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:22
* Perform mathematical operations on Vectors such as addition,subtraction and multiplication.

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
* Define a matrix.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
* Calculate size of a matrix.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:35
* Perform mathematical operations on Matrices such as addition, subtraction and multiplication.

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
The Pre-requisites are: Scilab should be installed on your system.

10
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
You should have listened to the Spoken Tutorial on Getting started with Scilab.

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
You should have Basic knowledge about Vectors and Matrices.

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:57
I am using <b>Windows 7</b> operating system and <b>Scilab 5.2.2</b> for demonstration.

13
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
Click on Scilab shortcut icon on your Desktop to launch Scilab.

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
This will open the Scilab console window.

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
Notice that the cursor is on the command prompt.

16
00:01:10 --> 00:01:18
I suggest that you practice this tutorial in Scilab simultaneously while pausing the video at regular intervals of time.

17
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
Let us start by defining a vector.

18
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
This can be done in two ways:

19
00:01:24 --> 00:01:36
By using spaces as: p is equal to open square bracket one space 2 space 3 close the square bracket and press Enter

20
00:01:37 --> 00:01:52
or using commas as: q is equal to open square bracket two comma three comma four close the square bracket and press Enter.

21
00:01:53 --> 00:02:02
We can find the length of a vector p by the command length of p and press Enter.

22
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
We can perform various mathematical operations on vectors such as:

23
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
* Addition of two vectors

24
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
* Substraction of two vectors and so on.

25
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
Transpose of a vector can be found by using apostrophe (also known as single-quote).

26
00:02:21 --> 00:02:26
p transpose is as shown.

27
00:02:27 --> 00:02:33
We can calculate p-transpose times q.

28
00:02:34 --> 00:02:42
The command p times q-transpose gives a scalar.

29
00:02:43 --> 00:02:49
Please pause the tutorial now and attempt exercise number one given in the video.

30
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
Now we will see how to define a matrix.

31
00:02:56 --> 00:03:03
Elements of a row of a matrix can be defined using spaces or commas similar to that shown for a vector.

32
00:03:04 --> 00:03:19
For example, let us define a 2 by 3 matrix P by typing capital P is equal to open square bracket 1 space 2 space 3 semicolon

33
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
4 space five space 6 close the square bracket and press Enter.

34
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
Note that semicolon is used for defining the next row of the matrix.

35
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Recall that Scilab is case sensitive.

36
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
Here variable P used to define matrix is in upper case

37
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
which is different from small p that was a vector.

38
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Would you want to check what small p is at this point?

39
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
We will now see how to find the size of a matrix using the <b>size</b> command.

40
00:03:53 --> 00:04:09
For this, type open square bracket row comma column close the sqaure bracket is equal to size of capital P, which is the matrix, and press Enter.

41
00:04:10 --> 00:04:16
You get the following output.

42
00:04:17 --> 00:04:26
Note that the length command will give the total number of elements in the matrix as you see.

43
00:04:27 --> 00:04:33
The <b>transpose</b> command works for the matrices as well, as shown hereÂ :

44
00:04:34 --> 00:04:40
<b>P transpose</b> gives the transpose of matrix P.

45
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Let us now define a 2 by 3 matrix Q:

46
00:04:45 --> 00:04:55
Capital Q is equal to open square bracket one space five space three semicolon, to enter into the next row

47
00:04:56 --> 00:05:02
two space four space eight, close the square bracket and press Enter.

48
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
Let us also recall P once more.

49
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
We can carry out calculations involving P and Q, just as we do in mathematics.

50
00:05:14 --> 00:05:28
For example, let us calculate E is equal to 2 times P plus 3 times Q and press enter:

51
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
You may want to verify whether these calculations are correct.

52
00:05:33 --> 00:05:43
Please pause the tutorial now and attempt exercise number two given with the video

53
00:05:44 --> 00:05:46
In this tutorial, we have learnt to:

54
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
* Define a vector using spaces or commas.

55
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
* Calculate length of a vector using the <b>length()</b> function.

56
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
* Find the transpose of a vector or a matrix using <b>apostrophe</b>.

57
00:05:59 --> 00:06:06
* Define a matrix by using space or comma to separate the columns and semicolon to separate the rows.

58
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
Find size of a matrix using <b>size()</b> function.

59
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
