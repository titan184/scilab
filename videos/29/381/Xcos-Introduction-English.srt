<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on<b> Xcos: Scilab Connected Object Simulator.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:16
<b>Xcos</b> is a <b>Scilab package</b> for modeling and simulation of dynamical systems. It includes both <b>continuous</b> and <b>discrete</b> systems.

3
00:00:17 --> 00:00:25
In this tutorial you will learn What is <b>XCOS</b>.  What is <b>palette</b>, Build block diagrams in <b>Xcos</b>

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:34
Setup the parameters of blocks, Setup the simulation parameters, Simulate the constructed block diagram.

5
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
To practice this tutorial, Scilab should be installed on your system.

6
00:00:40 --> 00:00:47
I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and Scilab version 5.3.3 for demonstration.

7
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
Open the <b>Scilab console</b> window on your computer.

8
00:00:52 --> 00:01:01
Go to applications and select <b>Xcos</b>OR Type <b>xcos</b> in your <b>Scilab console</b> window and press <b>Enter</b>

9
00:01:02 --> 00:01:13
By doing this, two windows will open. The two windows are<b>Palette browser</b> and <b>Untitled-Xcos</b> window

10
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
In <b>Palette browser</b>, you will find different types of blocks <b>Commonly Used Blocks</b>

11
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
<b>Continuous time system blocks</b> , <b>Discrete time systems blocks </b>and many more.

12
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
The other window, <b>Untitled-Xcos</b> is blank, with grids.

13
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
We will now simulate a <b>first order system</b> with a<b> step input</b>.

14
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
To begin, I will select a <b>transfer function block</b> from the <b>Continuous time systems palette</b>.

15
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
Drag this block to the <b>Untitled-Xcos</b> window.

16
00:01:48 --> 00:01:55
Select the required source in the <b>Sources palette</b>. I will scroll down and use the <b>STEP FUNCTION block</b>.

17
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
I will drag and place it before the <b>transfer function block.</b>

18
00:02:01 --> 00:02:07
Similarly, the output is displayed using the <b>CSCOPE block</b>, which is available in <b>Sinks palette.</b>

19
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
The <b>CSCOPE block</b> is placed after the <b>transfer function block.</b>

20
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
The red input port in <b>CSCOPE</b> denotes that this block is an <b>“event driven” block.</b>

21
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
It needs an <b>event</b> input for execution.

22
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
An <b>event generator block</b> is available in the <b>Event handling palette.</b>

23
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
The name of this block is <b>Clock underscore c</b>.

24
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
Drag and place this block above the CSCOPE block.

25
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
We have collected all the required blocks to do the simulation.

26
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Let us now connect the blocks together.

27
00:02:47 --> 00:02:54
Select the <b>output port</b> of <b>step function block</b> and connect it to the <b>input port</b> of the <b>transfer function block.</b>

28
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
Notice that the selected <b>input port</b> gets highlighted in green colour.

29
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
Similarly, connect the remaining blocks as shown.

30
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
Now we will set the parameters of each block.

31
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
First, go to the <b>step block</b> and double-click on it.

32
00:03:14 --> 00:03:22
A pop up window appears, asking for the value of <b>Step Time, Initial Value</b> and <b>Final Value</b>.

33
00:03:23 --> 00:03:31
<b>Step Time</b> is the time at which the <b>step change</b> will occur.We will keep it as 1, which is the default value.

34
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
<b>Initial Value</b> is the initial output value of the <b>step function</b>.

35
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
We will keep it as 0, which is the default value.

36
00:03:41 --> 00:03:49
<b>Final Value</b> is the output of the <b>step function</b>, after the <b>Step Time</b> is lapsed.We will change it to 2.

37
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
Click on <b>OK</b>.

38
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Follow the similar procedure to configure any other block.

39
00:03:56 --> 00:04:04
For <b>transfer function block,</b> the following configuration is required. <b>Numerator</b> value in<b> laplace domain</b> has to be entered.

40
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
We will keep it as 1, which is the default value.

41
00:04:09 --> 00:04:19
<b>Denominator</b> value in <b>laplace domain</b> has to entered. We will change it to <b>2 asterisk s plus 1</b>.Click on <b>OK</b>.

42
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Double click on <b>CSCOPE block,</b> to configure the following parameters.

43
00:04:25 --> 00:04:33
The value of<b> Ymin</b> and <b>Ymax</b> should be set, depending on the range of the value, of the variable to be plotted.

44
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
Set the value of <b>Ymin</b> to 0.

45
00:04:38 --> 00:04:45
Since I have given <b>step input</b> as 2, to display the output on graph, I should change the <b>Ymax</b> to any higher value.

46
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
We will change it to 3.

47
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
Make a mental note of the default value of the <b>refresh period</b>.The default value is 30.

48
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
We will keep the other parameters unchanged.Click on <b>OK</b>.

49
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
Now go to the <b>Simulation</b> in menu bar and click on <b>Setup</b>.

50
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
A pop up window appears.

51
00:05:11 --> 00:05:19
We will change the value of <b>Final integration time</b>.<b>Final integration time</b> decides how long the simulation will run.

52
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Recall the value of <b>refresh period</b> of the<b> CSCOPE block.</b>

53
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
I will keep the value of <b>Final integration time</b> equal to the value of <b>refresh period</b> of <b>CSCOPE block</b>

54
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
So, I will change it to 30.

55
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
Keep the other parameters unchanged. Click on <b>OK</b>.

56
00:05:39 --> 00:05:49
Now press <b>Control S</b> to save the file, with a suitable file name.I will save it as <b>firstorder.xcos</b>

57
00:05:50 --> 00:05:57
To start the simulation, click on the <b>Start</b> button, available on the menu bar of <b>Xcos</b> window.

58
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
A Graphic window will open, showing the <b>step response</b> of the first order <b>transfer function.</b>

59
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
We can save this plot as an image file.

60
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
To save the graph, go to the <b>File</b> menu and click on <b>Export to</b> option.

61
00:06:12 --> 00:06:19
I will name it as firstorder.png and click on <b>OK</b>

62
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
There are certain parameters which we chose to keep as the default value. These can be changed.

63
00:06:26 --> 00:06:35
For example In the<b> Clock underscore c block</b>, the <b>period</b>, which means the <b>sampling period</b> and <b>initial time</b> can be set.

64
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
In the <b>CSCOPE block,</b> the <b>output window number</b>,

65
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
<b>position, size, buffer size, graph color</b> etc. can also be set.

66
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
Pause the video here and solve the exercise given with the video.

67
00:06:52 --> 00:07:00
Simulate a <b>second order transfer function</b> with <b>damping ratio</b> of 0.5 and <b>angular frequency</b> equal to 1.

68
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
Try changing the color of output graph.

69
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
Using the first exercise, plot the <b>Step input</b> and the <b>output</b> in a single plot window.

70
00:07:11 --> 00:07:17
Now let us summarize.In this tutorial we have learnt to: Create <b>Xcos simulation</b> diagrams using the <b>palette browser</b>

71
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
Configure each block as per the simulation requirements

72
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
Setup the simulation parameters. Save the output plot.
