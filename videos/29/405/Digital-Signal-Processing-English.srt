Dear Friends,Welcome to the spoken tutorial on “<b>Signal Processing using Scilab</b>”

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:18
In this tutorial, using Scilab, I will show you how to Generate different kinds of signals , and Perform different operations to analyse signals.

3
00:00:19 --> 00:00:29
To record this tutorial, I am using <b>Ubuntu 11.04</b> as the operating system with <b>Scilab 5.3.3</b> version

4
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
Before practicing this tutorial, a learner should have a basic knowledge of Scilab.

5
00:00:35 --> 00:00:41
To know the basics of Scilab, please refer to the series of basic level of spoken tutorials in Scilab

6
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
which is available on our website www.spoken-tutorial.org

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:57
In this tutorial, I will describe about 3 basic Signals.Plotting continuous and discrete sine wave.Plotting <b>step function</b>. Plotting <b>ramp function</b>.

8
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
Let me start with “Plotting continuous and discrete sine wave”

9
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
Let us switch to the Scilab Console Window.

10
00:01:06 --> 00:01:16
Here type: <b>t equal to zero colon zero point one colon two multiplied by precentage pi semicolon.</b>

11
00:01:17 --> 00:01:32
Then <b>x equal to sin of t semicolon then plot 2D into bracket t comma x</b>and press <b>Enter</b> key on your keyboard.

12
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
This is a <b>continous sine wave</b>

13
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
Let us discuss the <b>discrete sine wave.</b>

14
00:01:39 --> 00:01:53
On the console window type: <b>plot two d3 within bracket invertes comma gnn comma t comma x and press Enter.</b>

15
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
This is <b>discrete sine wave.</b>

16
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
Let us now discuss about Plotting <b>step function</b> and plotting <b>ramp function.</b>

17
00:02:04 --> 00:02:13
I have already written the code to generate <b>step</b> and <b>ramp</b> signal in the file called <b>signals.sce.</b>

18
00:02:14 --> 00:02:26
Let us open this file <b>signal.sce</b> using <b>scilab editor</b>.Let us execute this code.Click on the “Execute” button in the Menu bar

19
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
<b>Step</b> and <b>Ramp</b> signal is displayed in this plot.

20
00:02:32 --> 00:02:42
Now let us learn how to perform different operations to analyse signals.Let us see how to perform <b>Convolution</b> between two signals.

21
00:02:43 --> 00:02:54
Let us switch to the Scilab Console window and type<b>x equals to within square bracket one comma two comma three comma four</b>

22
00:02:55 --> 00:03:03
Then type <b>h equals to within square bracket one comma one comma one</b>

23
00:03:04 --> 00:03:16
Now let us apply the <b>convolution</b> by typing<b> convol opening bracket x comma h closing bracket</b> and press Enter on your keyboard.

24
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
An output can be seen here.

25
00:03:20 --> 00:03:29
Now let us learn <b>Discrete fourier transform</b> for a discrete sequence by using the inbuilt command <b>dft().</b>

26
00:03:30 --> 00:03:40
On the console window here type <b>x equals to within square bracket one comma two comma three comma four</b>

27
00:03:41 --> 00:03:58
ThenType<b> within square bracket xf equals to dft into bracket x comma minus 1</b>Where x is the input vector and flag value is -1 for DFT.

28
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
Let us press Enter

29
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
The output appears as this
<p><b>10. </b>
<b>- 2. + 2.i </b>
<b>- 2. - 9.797D-16i </b>
<b>- 2. - 2.i </b>
</p>

30
00:04:05 --> 00:04:14
Now I will show you how to calculate inverse discrete <b>fourier transform</b>. This can be done by using the same inbuilt command <b>dft().</b>

31
00:04:15 --> 00:04:30
On the Scilab console window type: <b>squareBracket x equals to dft within bracket xf comma 1</b>Here the <b>flag value</b> is 1 for <b>idft.</b>

32
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
This is the output

33
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
Let us calculate discrete fourier transform using <b>fft()</b>

34
00:04:39 --> 00:04:48
On the console window, type <b>x= x equals to square bracket one comma two comma three comma four</b>

35
00:04:49 --> 00:04:58
Press Enter and type  y equals to fft within bracket x comma minus one

36
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
Press Enter and you can see the output as these:-<b>10. - 2. + 2.i - 2. - 2. - 2.i </b>

37
00:05:05 --> 00:05:11
Let us now see how to calculate inverse discrete fourier transform by using <b>fft().</b>

38
00:05:12 --> 00:05:32
On the Scilab console window type <b>y equals to within square bracket ten comma minus two plus two into percentage i comma minus two comma minus two minus two into percentage i.</b>

39
00:05:33 --> 00:05:44
and Press EnterType  x equals to fft within bracket y comma 1 and Press Enter

40
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
The output will be displayed as this

41
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
Let us now find out the correlation between two vectors.

42
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
To do this on the Scilab console window,

43
00:05:56 --> 00:06:07
Type <b>x equals to within square bracket one comma two comma three comma four</b>and press Enter

44
00:06:08 --> 00:06:19
Type<b> x2 equals to within square braccket one comma three comma one comma five </b>and press Enter

45
00:06:20 --> 00:06:33
Type <b>R x  x two equals to corr within bracket x comma x two comma four </b>and press Enter

46
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
The output will be displayed as shown.

47
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
Let us learn how to sample the given signal

48
00:06:42 --> 00:06:51
Let me open sampling.sce where I have already written the code in sampling.sce .Here click on the “<b>Execute</b>”button.

49
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
A plot is displayed.

50
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
Let us summarise.

51
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
In this tutorial we have learnt How to Plot sine, step and ramp signal.

52
00:07:04 --> 00:07:11
To perform Linear convolution by convol().To perform DFT and IDFT by dft().

53
00:07:12 --> 00:07:19
To perform FFT by fft(). To find out the Correlation by corr(). To do sampling
