<b>Narration</b>

00:00:01 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Conditional Branching</b> in <b>Scilab</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
To practice this tutorial, open the Scilab console window on your computer.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:18
We will discuss two types of conditional constructs in Scilab that is the  <b>if-then-else</b> construct and the <b>select-case</b> conditional construct.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
The <b>if statement</b> allows us to execute a group of statements if a given condition is satisfied.

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
Let me give you an example:

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:36
<b>n is equal 42 if n is equal to equal to 42 (n==42) then disp "the number is 42" end</b> of if construct.

7
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
Here, 'is equal to'(=) is the assignment operator, which assigns 42 to the variable n,

8
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
and 'is equal to is equal to' (==) is the equality operator which checks for the equality between the right hand and the left hand side operands.

9
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
In this case 'n' and 42 and gives the result in Boolean.

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
Here the comma after the first line is optional.

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Also the <b>then</b> keyword is optional.

12
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
It can be replaced by a <b>comma</b> or a <b>carriage return</b>.

13
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
The <b>end</b> keyword ends the <b>if</b> construct.

14
00:01:11 --> 00:01:19
On executing the script, we see the output as follows.

15
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
So far we have seen how to execute a set of statements, if a condition is true.

16
00:01:26 --> 00:01:35
Now we will see how to execute another set of statements if that condition is false or we may wish to check if some other condition is satisfied.

17
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
We can do this by using <b>else</b> or <b>elseif</b> keyword respectively.

18
00:01:40 --> 00:01:40
Here is how we do it.

19
00:01:41 --> 00:01:54
In this example, 54 is assigned to a variable 'n' and checked for both <b>true</b> condition using 'if' and <b>false</b> condition using 'else' as described:

20
00:01:55 --> 00:02:02
I will cut this, paste in the Scilab console, hit <b>Enter</b>.

21
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
You see the output.

22
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
If you notice, the examples shown above are on multiple lines.

23
00:02:09 --> 00:02:18
They can also be written in a single line with proper semicolons and commas.

24
00:02:19 --> 00:02:26
I will cut this and paste in the Scilab to execute. Hit <b>Enter</b>.

25
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
The <b>select</b> statement allows to combine several branches in a clear and simple way.

26
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
Depending on the value of a variable, it allows to perform the statement corresponding to the <b>case</b> keyword.

27
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
There can be as many branches as required.

28
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
Let us try with an example.

29
00:02:44 --> 00:02:58
We will assign 100 to a variable 'n' and check the cases 42, 54 and a default case represented by <b>else</b>.

30
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
Cut,  paste, hit <b>Enter</b>.

31
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Here we see the output .

32
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
This brings us to the end of this Spoken Tutorial on <b>Conditional Branching</b> using <b>Scilab</b>.

33
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
In this tutorial we have learnt the <b>if - elseif - else</b> statement and the <b>select</b> statement.

34
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
There are many other functions in Scilab which will be covered in other spoken tutorials.

35
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Keep watching the Scilab links.

36
00:03:27 --> 00:03:34
Spoken Tutorials are part of the Talk to a Teacher project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT.

37
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
