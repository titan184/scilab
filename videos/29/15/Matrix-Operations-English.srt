<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Matrix Operations</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
At the end of this spoken tutorial, you will be able to:

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
* Access the elements of Matrix

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
* Determine the determinant, inverse and eigen values of a matrix.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
* Define special matrices.

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
* Perform elementary row operations.

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
* Solve the system of <b>linear equations</b>.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
The prerequisites are:

9
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Scilab should be installed on your system.

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:41
You should have listened to the Spoken Tutorial: <b>Getting started with Scilab</b> and <b>Vector Operations</b>.

11
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
I am using <b>Windows 7</b> operating system and <b>Scilab 5.2.2</b> for demonstration.

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:58
Start Scilab by double-clicking on the Scilab icon present on your Desktop.

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:07
It is suggested that the user should practice this tutorial in Scilab simultaneously while pausing the video at regular intervals of time.

14
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
Recall that in the Spoken Tutorial: <b>Vector Operations</b>,

15
00:01:12 --> 00:01:36
matrix E was defined as E is equal to open square bracket 5 space 19 space 15 semicolon 8 space 22 space 36 close the square bracket and press Enter.

16
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
Let us now see how to address individual elements of a matrix, separately.

17
00:01:42 --> 00:01:55
To access the element in the first row and second column, type E into bracket 1,2 and press enter

18
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
It is easy to extract an entire row or an entire column of a matrix in Scilab .

19
00:02:03 --> 00:02:22
For example, first row of E can be obtained using the following command: E1 = E into bracket 1 comma colon and press Enter.

20
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
The command returns all the elements of the first row, in the order of their appearance in the row.

21
00:02:30 --> 00:02:43
<b>Colon</b>, when used alone, refers to all the elements of row or column, depending upon whether it appears as a first or a second entry respectively inside the bracket.

22
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
Also, any subset of a matrix can be extracted using a colon (“:”).

23
00:02:49 --> 00:02:59
For example, the set of elements starting from second to third columns of E can be obtained using the following command:

24
00:03:00 --> 00:03:17
E2 = E of colon comma 2 colon 3 close the bracket and press Enter.

25
00:03:18 --> 00:03:27
In the above, the second entry in the bracket, that is, "2 colon 3" makes a reference to elements from column 2 to column 3.

26
00:03:28 --> 00:03:37
If the size of the matrix is not known, <b>$ </b>(dollar ) symbol can be used to extract the last row or column of that matrix.

27
00:03:38 --> 00:03:45
For example to extract all rows of the last column of the matrix E, we will type

28
00:03:46 --> 00:04:05
Elast col= E into brackets colon comma dollar sign close the bracket and press Enter.

29
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
Now, let us learn how to calculate the <b>determinant</b> of a <b>square matrix</b> using the command <b>det</b>.

30
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
Recall that in the Spoken Tutorial, <b>Vector Operations</b>, we had defined A as

31
00:04:19 --> 00:04:49
A = open square bracket 1 space 2 space minus 1 semicolon  -2 space  - 6 space 4 semicolon -1 space  -3 space 3 close the square bracket and press Enter.

32
00:04:50 --> 00:04:59
Let us calculate the determinant of A by the command <b>det of A</b>  and press Enter.

33
00:05:00 --> 00:05:08
To calculate the <b>inverse</b> and the <b>eigen values</b> of a matrix, the commands <b>inv</b> and <b>spec</b> can be used respectively.

34
00:05:09 --> 00:05:28
For example: inv of A  gives the inverse of A and spec of A gives the <b>eigen values</b> of  matrix A.

35
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
See <b>help spec</b> to see how <b>eigen vectors</b> can also be obtained using this command.

36
00:05:35 --> 00:05:51
<b>Square</b> or <b>cube</b> of a square matrix A can be calculated by simply typing <b>A square</b>  or <b>A cube </b>respectively.

37
00:05:52 --> 00:06:04
A caret symbol is used to raise a matrix to power, like in ordinary arithmetic operations. In our keyboard, it is obtained by pressing shift+6.

38
00:06:05 --> 00:06:16
Please pause the tutorial now and attempt the exercise number one given in the video.

39
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
Certain special matrices can also be created in Scilab.

40
00:06:24 --> 00:06:35
For example, a matrix of zeros with 3 rows and 4 columns can be created using <b>zeros</b> command

41
00:06:36 --> 00:06:46
zeros into bracket 3 comma 4  and press Enter.

42
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
A matrix of all ones can be created with <b>ones</b> command as follows:

43
00:06:53 --> 00:07:00
ones into bracket 2 comma 4  gives a matrix of all ones.

44
00:07:01 --> 00:07:06
It is easy to create an <b>identity matrix</b> using the  <b>eye</b> command:

45
00:07:07 --> 00:07:15
' e y e' of 4 comma 4 gives a 4 by 4 identity matrix.

46
00:07:16 --> 00:07:24
A user may need a matrix consisting of pseudo random numbers. It can be generated using the <b>rand</b> command as follows:

47
00:07:25 --> 00:07:38
p=rand into bracket 2, 3  and press Enter

48
00:07:39 --> 00:07:54
In linear systems, one of the important sets of operations a user carries out on matrices are the elementary row and column operations.

49
00:07:55 --> 00:08:06
These operations involve executing row operations on a matrix to make entries below a nonzero number, zero. This can be done easily in Scilab.

50
00:08:07 --> 00:08:16
Recall that in the Spoken Tutorial <b>Vector Operations</b>, we had defined the matrix P as follows.

51
00:08:17 --> 00:08:32
P = open square bracket 1 space 2 space 3  semicolon 4 space 11 space 6  close the square bracket and press Enter.

52
00:08:33 --> 00:08:43
Let us consider an example where the element in the second row, first column is to be transformed to zero using elementary row and column operation.

53
00:08:44 --> 00:08:55
The operation can be executed by multiplying the first row by 4 and subtracting it from the second row as in the following command:

54
00:08:56 --> 00:09:27
P into bracket 2 comma colon is equal to  P into bracket 2 comma colon  minus 4 multiplied by P into bracket 1 comma colon and press Enter.

55
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
The procedure can be extended to larger systems and to other forms of elementary column operations.

56
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
Rows and columns can be easily appended to matrices.

57
00:09:39 --> 00:09:47
For example, to append a row containing the elements [5 5 -2] to P, the following command is used:

58
00:09:48 --> 00:10:13
T =  open square bracket P semicolon, open another square bracket write down  the elements 5 5 -2 close both the square brackets and press Enter.

59
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
The semicolon after P states that anything after it should go to the next row.

60
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
This is expected in the way a matrix is defined.

61
00:10:24 --> 00:10:33
As an exercise, please pause here and check if the brackets around the new row, in the command just executed, are really required.

62
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
Matrix notations are used while solving equations.

63
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
Let us solve the following set of linear equations:

64
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
x1 + 2 x2 − x3 = 1

65
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
−2 x1 − 6 x2 + 4 x3 = −2

66
00:10:54 --> 00:10:59
and − x1 − 3 x2 + 3 x3 = 1

67
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
The above set of equations can be written in  Ax = b form.

68
00:11:05 --> 00:11:10
The solution is then given as inverse of A times b.

69
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
Let us solve the set of equations.

70
00:11:15 --> 00:11:45
A is defined as A =  open square bracket 1 space  2 space  -1 semicolon -2 space -6 space 4 semicolon -1 space  -3 space  3 close the square bracket and press Enter.

71
00:11:46 --> 00:12:03
B can be defined as b  is equal to square bracket 1 semicolon -2 semicolon 1 close the square bracket and press Enter.

72
00:12:04 --> 00:12:18
The solution, x, can be obtained by using x = inv  of A multiplied by b.

73
00:12:19 --> 00:12:25
It is worth noting that it is a small letter 'i' in the command, <b>inv</b>.

74
00:12:26 --> 00:12:32
Alternatively, the same result can be achieved using a <b>backslash operation</b> in Scilab.

75
00:12:33 --> 00:12:43
Let's do this in Scilab: x  is equal to A backslash b and press Enter.

76
00:12:44 --> 00:12:54
It gives the same result. Type <b>help backslash</b> and <b>help inv</b> in Scilab to know more about individual advantages and disadvantages.

77
00:12:55 --> 00:13:04
The integrity of the solution can be verified by back substitution, that is, by calculating Ax-b:

78
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
A multiplied by x minus b.

79
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
The above exercise verifies the result achieved earlier.

80
00:13:14 --> 00:13:26
It is possible that in some systems the above verification exercise may not yield a matrix with exact zeros as its elements due to intermediate floating point operations.

81
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
However, one will indeed get a very small number, typically of the order of 10 raised to -16.

82
00:13:34 --> 00:13:48
Please pause the tutorial now and attempt exercise number two given in the video.

83
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
