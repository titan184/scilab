00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Dear Friends,  Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on <b>Composite Numerical Integration</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
At the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:16
Develop <b>Scilab</b> code for different <b>Composite Numerical Integration algorithms</b>

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
Divide the <b>integral</b> into equal <b>intervals</b>

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Apply the algorithm to each <b>interval</b> and

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Calculate the <b>composite value of the integral</b>.

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
To record this tutorial, I am using

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
<b>Ubuntu 12.04</b> as the operating system

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
with <b>Scilab 5.3.3</b> version.

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Before practicing this tutorial, a learner should have basic knowledge of

11
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
<b>Scilab</b> and

12
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
<b>Integration using Numerical Methods</b>.

13
00:00:47 --> 00:00:54
For <b>Scilab</b>, please refer to the relevant tutorials available on the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> website.

14
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
<b>Numerical Integration</b> is the

15
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
study of how the numerical value of an <b>integral</b> can be found.

16
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
It is used when exact mathematical integration is not available.

17
00:01:08 --> 00:01:14
It approximates a <b>definite integral</b> from values of the <b>integrand</b>.

18
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
Let us study <b>Composite Trapezoidal Rule.</b>

19
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
This rule is the extension of <b>trapezoidal rule</b>.

20
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
We divide the interval <b>a comma b </b> into <b>n</b> equal intervals.

21
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
Then <b>h equals to b minus a divided by n</b> is the common length of the intervals.

22
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
Then <b>composite trapezoidal rule</b> is given by:

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:56
<b> The integral of the function F of x in the interval a to b is approximately equal to h multiplied by the sum of the values of the function at x zero to x n</b>

24
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
Let us solve an example using <b>composite trapezoidal rule.</b>

25
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
Assume the number of intervals n is equal to ten (n=10).

26
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
Let us look at the code for <b>Composite Trapezoidal Rule</b> on <b>Scilab editor</b>

27
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
We first define the function with parameters <b>f , a , b , n.</b>

28
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
<b>f </b>refers to the function we have to solve,

29
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
<b>a</b> is the lower limit of the integral,

30
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
<b> b</b> is the upper limit of the integral and

31
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
<b>n</b> is the number of intervals.

32
00:02:34 --> 00:02:41
<b>linspace</b> function is used to create ten equal intervals between zero and one.

33
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
We find the value of the integral and store it in <b> I one</b>.

34
00:02:49 --> 00:03:01
Click on <b>Execute</b> on <b>Scilab editor</b> and choose <b>Save and execute </b> the code.

35
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
Define the example function by typing:

36
00:03:05 --> 00:03:29
<b>d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one by open parenthesis two asterisk x plus one close parenthesis close quote close parenthesis</b>

37
00:03:30 --> 00:03:40
Press <b>Enter </b>. Type <b>Trap underscore composite open parenthesis f comma zero comma one comma ten close parenthesis</b>

38
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
Press <b>Enter </b>.

39
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
The answer is displayed on the <b>console </b>.

40
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
Next we shall study <b>Composite Simpson's rule.</b>

41
00:03:51 --> 00:04:02
In this rule, we decompose the interval <b> a comma b</b> into <b>n is greater than 1</b>  sub-intervals of equal length.

42
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
Apply <b>Simpson's rule</b> to each interval.

43
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
We get the value of the integral to be:

44
00:04:10 --> 00:04:18
<b>h by three multiplied by the sum of f zero, four into f one , two into f two to f n</b>.

45
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
Let us solve an example using <b>Composite Simpson's rule. </b>

46
00:04:24 --> 00:04:31
We are given a <b>function one by one plus x cube d x in the interval one to two</b>.

47
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
Let the number of intervals be <b>twenty </b>.

48
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Let us look at the code for  <b>Composite Simpson's rule</b>.

49
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
We first define the function with parameters <b>f , a , b , n. </b>

50
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
<b>f</b> refers to the function we have to solve,

51
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
<b>a</b>  is the lower limit of the integral,

52
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
<b>b</b> is the upper limit of the integral and

53
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
<b>n</b> is the number of intervals.

54
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
We find two sets of points.

55
00:05:04 --> 00:05:09
We find the value of the function with one set and multiply it with two.

56
00:05:10 --> 00:05:15
With the other set, we find the value and multiply it with four.

57
00:05:16 --> 00:05:23
We sum these values and multiply it with <b>h by three and store the final value in I </b>.

58
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
Let us execute the code.

59
00:05:28 --> 00:05:38
Save and execute the file <b>Simp underscore composite dot s c i</b>.

60
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
Let me clear the screen first.

61
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
Define the function given in the example by typing:

62
00:05:45 --> 00:06:11
<b>d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one divided by open parenthesis one plus x cube close parenthesis close quote close parenthesis</b>

63
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Press <b>Enter </b>.

64
00:06:14 --> 00:06:23
Type <b>Simp underscore composite open parenthesis f comma one comma two comma twenty close parenthesis</b>

65
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
Press <b>Enter </b>.

66
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
The answer is displayed on the console.

67
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
Let us now look at <b>Composite Midpoint Rule.</b>

68
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
It integrates polynomials of degree one or less,

69
00:06:40 --> 00:06:48
divides the interval <b>a comma b</b> into a <b> sub-intervals</b>of equal width.

70
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Finds the midpoint of each interval indicated by <b>x i </b>.

71
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
We find the sum of the values of the integral at each midpoint.

72
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
Let us solve this problem using <b>Composite Midpoint Rule</b>.

73
00:07:05 --> 00:07:14
<b>We are given a function one minus x square d x in the interval zero to one point five</b>.

74
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
We assume <b>n</b> is equal to <b>twenty </b>.

75
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
Let us look at the code for <b>Composite Midpoint rule</b>.

76
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
We first define the function with parameters <b>f , a , b , n. </b>

77
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
<b>f </b> refers to the function we have to solve,

78
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
<b>a</b>  is the lower limit of the integral,

79
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
<b>b </b> is the upper limit of the integral and

80
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
<b>n </b> is the number of intervals.

81
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
We find the midpoint of each interval.

82
00:07:45 --> 00:07:52
Find the value of integral at each midpoint and then find the sum and store it in <b>I.</b>

83
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
Let us now solve the example.

84
00:07:55 --> 00:08:03
Save and execute the file <b>mid underscore composite dot s c i</b>.

85
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Let me clear the screen.

86
00:08:08 --> 00:08:12
We define the function given in the example by typing:

87
00:08:13 --> 00:08:36
<b>d e f f open parenthesis open single quote open square bracket y close square bracket is equal to f of x close quote comma open quote y is equal to one minus x square close quote close parenthesis</b>

88
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
Press <b>Enter</b>.

89
00:08:39 --> 00:08:52
Then type <b>mid underscore composite open parenthesis f comma zero comma one point five comma twenty close parenthesis</b>

90
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
Press <b>Enter </b>. The answer is displayed on the <b>console</b>.
