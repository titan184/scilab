<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the spoken tutorial on <b>Plotting 2D graphs</b> with <b>Scilab</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
Assuming that Scilab is installed on your computer, we will discuss <b>plots</b> in Scilab.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
Scilab offers many ways to create and customize various types of 2D and 3D plots.

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:23
The several common charts Scilab can create are: <b>x-y plots, contour plots, 3D plots, histograms, bar charts</b> etc...

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
Now open your Scilab console window.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
I will use Plotting.sce file to cut and paste the commands.

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
In order to plot, we need a set of points. Let us create a sequence of equally spaced points.

8
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
This can be done by the <b>linspace</b> command which creates a linearly equally spaced vector.

9
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
For Example,

10
00:00:48 --> 00:00:56
<b>x</b> is a row vector with 5 points linearly equally spaced between 1 and 10.

11
00:00:57 --> 00:01:07
Similarly <b>y</b> is a row vector with linearly equally spaced 5 points between 1 and 20.

12
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
More information on <b>linspace</b> can be obtained from the <b>Help</b> documentation.

13
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
We will now plot a graph with the arguments x and y using the <b>plot</b> function.

14
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
This is similar to the one used in <b>matlab</b>.

15
00:01:23 --> 00:01:30
<b>plot(x,y)</b> creates a graph of x verses y as you see.

16
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
Notice that the <b>Graphics window</b> is labeled as '0'.

17
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
We will open another graphic window using the <b>xset</b> function.

18
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
I will close this.

19
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
Cut the <b>xset</b> function, paste in Scilab, hit Enter.

20
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
You will see a <b>Graphic window number 1</b>.

21
00:01:54 --> 00:02:02
Note that two arguments are passed to this function namely the 'window' and 1.

22
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
The next graph will be plotted on this window.

23
00:02:06 --> 00:02:13
For Scilab, <b>plot2d</b> is the native function used to plot 2d graphs.

24
00:02:14 --> 00:02:25
<b>plot2d</b> command plots a graph of x verses y as you see.

25
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
Notice that there is a third argument called 'style'.

26
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
<b>style</b> argument is optional. It is used to customize the appearance of the plot.

27
00:02:36 --> 00:02:43
For positive values of style, the curve is plain with different colours like green for 3 in our case.

28
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
The default value of style is 1.

29
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Try plotting graphs for negative values and see the difference in appearance yourself.

30
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
Also we can set the start points and end points for x and y axes by passing the fourth argument.

31
00:02:57 --> 00:03:06
It is called <b>rect</b>. As you see,

32
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
we have x axis starting from 1 to 10 and y axis from 1 to 20.

33
00:03:14 --> 00:03:23
The order of argument in the <b>rect</b> command is <b>xmin, ymin, xmax</b> and <b>ymax</b>.

34
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
Let us now learn about title, axis and legends.

35
00:03:28 --> 00:03:37
To configure labels to the axis and title to the plot we can use the commands <b>title, xlabel</b> and <b>ylabel</b>.

36
00:03:38 --> 00:03:44
I will cut this set of commands and paste in the console. Hit Enter.

37
00:03:45 --> 00:03:57
You will see that the graph has been labeled x to the x-axis, y to the y-axis and the title of the graph is 'My title'.

38
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
You may want to configure the <b>title</b> and <b>axes</b> of the plot in a single command instead of 3

39
00:04:04 --> 00:04:10
For this purpose we use the <b>xtitle</b>  command with all the 3 arguments.

40
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
I will cut this command, paste in scilab, <b>Enter</b>.

41
00:04:18 --> 00:04:25
Now you see that the x axis label is X axis , Y axis and the title is 'My title'.

42
00:04:26 --> 00:04:35
The <b>clf()</b> function that I am typing now, will clear the graphic window as you see.

43
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
It is useful while plotting different graphs on the same graphic window.

44
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
I will close this window.

45
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
Sometimes we need to compare two sets of data in the same plot, that is, one set of x data and two sets of y data.

46
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
Let us see an example for this, I will scroll down.

47
00:04:56 --> 00:05:02
We will define the x-axis points in a row vector <b>x</b> using the <b>linspace</b> command.

48
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Let us define a function

49
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
y1 = x square.

50
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
plot x verses y1.

51
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
Define another function y2 = 2 x square.

52
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
plot x verses y2.

53
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
We will also give label and title to our graph.

54
00:05:22 --> 00:05:32
Notice that we have additionally passed ”o-” and ”+ -” commands to the plot function, to change the appearance of the curve.

55
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
These arguments are not a part of the <b>plot2d</b> function.

56
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
They can be used only with the <b>plot</b> function.

57
00:05:41 --> 00:05:48
I will copy these set of commands and paste in the Scilab console.

58
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
You see the graph.

59
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
Wouldn't it be of great help to know which curve is associated with which function?

60
00:05:56 --> 00:06:07
This can be achieved using the <b>legend</b> command as you see.

61
00:06:08 --> 00:06:18
"o-" curve represents function y1=x square  and "+-" curve represents function y2=2*x^2 (y2=2x square)

62
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
I will close this graphic window.

63
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
We will now discuss about <b>plot2d demos</b> and <b>subplot</b> function.

64
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
Scilab provides <b>demos</b> for all its major functions.

65
00:06:31 --> 00:06:38
<b>Demos</b> of <b>plot2d</b> can be viewed through the <b>demonstration</b> tab.

66
00:06:39 --> 00:06:50
Click on <b>Graphics</b>, click <b>2D and 3D plots</b> and select a demo out of the various demos provided.

67
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
I will click on <b>plot2d</b>.

68
00:06:54 --> 00:06:54
You will see the demo graph.

69
00:06:55 --> 00:07:01
The code for this graph can also be seen by clicking on the <b>view code</b> button here.

70
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
This link does not open in <b>Mac OS</b> but  it works in <b>Windows</b> and <b>Linux</b>.

71
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
Never the less in Mac the code can be viewed through the directory.

72
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
Let us go to the terminal.

73
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
Currently I am in 'demos' directory of Scilab 5.2 as shown.

74
00:07:21 --> 00:07:26
The full path to this directory is shown here.

75
00:07:27 --> 00:07:35
We will type <b>ls</b> to see the list of demos available, as you see here.

76
00:07:36 --> 00:07:45
Then we will select the 2d_3d_plots directory and hit <b>Enter</b>.

77
00:07:46 --> 00:07:54
Type <b>ls</b> again to see the various <b>demo code</b> available in the 'sce' files.

78
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
We will view the code for the demo which we have seen earlier.

79
00:08:00 --> 00:08:10
Type <b>more plot2d.dem.sce</b> and hit <b>Enter</b>.

80
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
Here you will see the code for the demo graph of plot2d function.

81
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
I will close the terminal.

82
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
I will close the demo graph and the demo window.

83
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Similarly you can go through the other demos and explore Scilab.

84
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
Let us now discuss about <b>subplot</b> function.

85
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
The <b>subplot()</b> function divides the graphics window into a matrix of sub-windows.

86
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
To explain this function we will use demos for plotting 2D graphs in Scilab.

87
00:08:43 --> 00:08:57
For example, type <b>plot2d</b> in your console and see the demo plot for this function.

88
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
I will close this window.

89
00:09:00 --> 00:09:09
The <b>subplot</b> command breaks the graphics window into a '2 by 2' matrix of sub-windows represented by the first two arguments in the subplot command.

90
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
The third argument denotes the current window in which the plot will be plotted.

91
00:09:15 --> 00:09:23
I will execute this whole set of commands by copying it to the scilab console.

92
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
You can see 4 plots in a single plot window .

93
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
The plot obtained can be saved as an image on your computer.

94
00:09:32 --> 00:09:38
Click on the graphic window, go to <b>File</b> menu, select <b>Export to</b> .

95
00:09:39 --> 00:09:49
Give a suitable title to your plot.

96
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
Select a destination folder to save your file.

97
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
Select the file format in which you want your image to appear.

98
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
I will select the JPEG format and click <b>Save</b>.

99
00:10:05 --> 00:10:10
Browse through the directory to open the image and verify yourself whether it has been saved or not.

100
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on <b>Plotting in Scilab</b>.

101
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
There are many other functions in Scilab which will be covered in other spoken tutorials.

102
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
Keep watching the Scilab links.

103
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
Spoken Tutorials are part of the Talk to a Teacher project, supported by the National Mission on Education through ICT.
